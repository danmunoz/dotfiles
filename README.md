**Warning:** Before using the content of this repo, you should download, review and modify it to suit your needs. Use it at your own risk!

## Installation

### 1. Get the files
Depending on your current situation, you could either have or not have (fresh install) git installed on your computer:

*** Git already Installed ***
You can clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danmunoz/dotfiles && cd dotfiles
```

*** Git ***not*** installed ***
Run this command to download and unzip the repo into your current directory:

```bash
curl https://github.com/danmunoz/dotfiles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -L -o dotfiles.zip && unzip dotfiles.zip && rm -f dotfiles.zip \
&& cd dotfiles-main
```
### 2. Run the script
Once you have the files on your machine, just run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

### Private information customization

In order to keep private information (e.g. git name) outside of a public repository, there's the possibility to add an additional file named `.extra` into the `./dotfiles` directory which will be sourced by `.zshrc` every time terminal is launched.

This is how my `.extra` file would look like:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Daniel Munoz"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="daniel@example.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Aliases
alias secret_project="cd /path/to/secret"
```

You could also use `.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. Itâ€™s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/danmunoz/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.
